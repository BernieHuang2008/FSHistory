Do you know how many Flight Simulators Microsoft developed? Dependent on how you count it is more than [ten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator) with [Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020)](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_(2020)) being the latest version  that is being released or has been released at the time of reading this document. 

See how it all began. Play the first four flight simulator games Microsoft developed from 1982 to 1989. It has full mouse and keyboard control and can be even enjoyed on your mobile. However a full IBM style keyboard is recommended.

# Technical aspects

 * Emulates an 80x86 and features from a 286 and a 386 CPU.
 * Implements DOS and BIOS functions similar to DOSBOX.
 * Developed in C.
 * Compiles to an ordinary executable by using the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL).
 * Compiles to WebAssembly via the LLVM compiler by using my own trivial libc implementation.
