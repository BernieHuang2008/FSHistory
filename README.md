This repository emulates an x86 CPU and DOS, enough to emulate the first four Microsoft Flight Simulator games.

The key features are:

 * Emulates an 80x86 and features from a 286 and a 386 CPU.
 * Implements DOS and BIOS functions similar to DOSBOX.
 * Developed in C.
 * Compiles to a normal executable by using the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL).
 * Compiles to webassembly via the llvm compiler by using my own trivial libc implementation.
