This repository lets you play the first four Flight Simulators from Microsoft.

The key features are:

 * Emulates an 80x86 and features from a 286 and a 386 CPU.
 * Implements DOS and BIOS functions similar to DOSBOX.
 * Developed in C.
 * Compiles to an ordinary executable by using the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL).
 * Compiles to WebAssembly via the LLVM compiler by using my own trivial libc implementation.
